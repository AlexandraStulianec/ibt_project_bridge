# Bridge Between Ethereum and Sui

This project implements a bridge between **Ethereum** and **Sui** blockchains, allowing users to transfer IBT tokens between the two chains. 
The bridge works by burning tokens on the source chain and minting them on the destination chain.

## Setup Instructions

> **Note**: Because of some issues with the contracts/ethereum I put a zip file with all the folders and files for the project.

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Install Ethereum contract dependencies:
```bash
cd ../ethereum
forge install
forge build
```

### 4. Build the Sui contract:
```bash
cd ../sui/ibt_token
sui move build
```

## Deploying Contracts

### Ethereum Contract

#### 1. Start a local Ethereum node (Anvil):
```bash
anvil
```

#### 2. In a new terminal, deploy the contract:
```bash
cd ethereum
forge create <NAME_OF_THE_FILE> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```
> **Note**: Replace `<PRIVATE_KEY>` and `<NAME_OF_THE_FILE>` with your Anvil private key and file name.

#### 3. Update the contract address in the frontend configuration:
   - Open `frontend/src/contracts/ethereum.ts`
   - Update `ETH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the deployed contract address

### Sui Contract

#### 1. Deploy the Sui contract to the local network:
```bash
cd sui/ibt_token
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

#### 2. Update the following constants in `frontend/src/contracts/sui.ts`:
   - `SUI_PACKAGE_ID`: Package ID from deployment output
   - `SUI_TREASURY_CAP_ID`: TreasuryCap object ID from deployment output

## Running the Frontend

### 1. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access the application:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Connect your wallets:
   - **MetaMask**: Connect to Anvil (localhost:8545)
   - **Sui Wallet**: Connect to the local Sui network with sui start
> **Note**: Connect to the wallets after starting the servers.
